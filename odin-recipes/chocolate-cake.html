    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Oil and line the base 
            of two 18cm sandwich tins. Sieve the flour, cocoa powder and 
            bicarbonate of soda into a bowl. Add the caster sugar and mix well.</li>
        <li>Make a well in the centre and add the golden syrup, eggs, sunflower 
            oil and milk. Beat well with an electric whisk until smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into the two tins and bake for 25-30 mins until risen 
            and firm to the touch. Remove from oven, leave to cool for 10 mins before 
            turning out onto a cooling rack.</li>
        <li>To make the icing, beat the unsalted butter in a bowl until soft. 
            Gradually sieve and beat in the icing sugar and cocoa powder, then add 
            enough of the milk to make the icing fluffy and spreadable.</li> 
        <li>Sandwich the two cakes together with the butter icing and cover the sides 
            and the top of the cake with more icing.</li>
    </ol>
